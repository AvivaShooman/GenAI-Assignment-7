We are an app platform for \\ndevelopers that is used today by about one in five schools in America. We started it about \\ntwo years ago. \\n  \\nSales has been key. I want to use this time to share some of the things that have worked for \\nme along the way. Of course, there\\'s a million ways to do this, so you\\'ll find what works for \\nyou. \\n  \\nFirst I want to start about how I used to perceive sales. A lot of people see sales as having \\nmystique around it. It\\'s people who are articulate and impossibly charming. They have \\nthese killer closing lines that they use. This is how I saw sales. I think this is how a lot of \\nfounders I talk to see sales because they say things to me like, \"You know, we\\'re just going \\nto work on the product and build a great product and then when it\\'s finally finished, we\\'re \\ngoing hire the sales people.\" What I\\'ve learned is that when it comes to \"hiring the sales \\npeople,\" as a founder, the reality is that it\\'s you. Paul Graham likes to talk about how \\nthere\\'s two things you should be doing at any point in time when you\\'re starting your \\ncompany. You should be either talking to your users or building your product. The talking to \\nyour users part, that\\'s selling. This is intimidating to some people because they\\'re like, \"I\\'ve \\nnever done sales, and I wouldn\\'t even know where to begin.\" It turns out that as a founder \\nyou have some unique advantages that make it possible for you to be really, really good at \\nsales. One of those is your passion for the product and what you\\'re building. The second is \\nyour knowledge of the industry and the problem that you\\'re solving. Those two things \\nactually totally trump sales experience from what I\\'ve seen. \\n  \\nThis is actually my co-founder doing sales. This is what sales looks like in the very early \\nstage of a startup. It\\'s not Don Drapers. It\\'s a lot of calls like these. This is something that \\neven as a founder who has never done it before, is very easy to do but you have to commit \\nyourself. What we did at Clever is we dedicated one founder, which was me, to peel off and \\nsay, \"Ok, Tyler you gotta go figure this out and work on this full time because it\\'s so \\nimportant to our business.\" \\n  \\nThe first thing that everybody knows about sales is it\\'s a funnel.

And now, you’re stuck with me. We’ll see how that goes. \\nUnlike Paul when he was talking in the Q&A and you guys asked him what he’d do if he was \\nin college today and he said physics, I actually indulged myself. I went and did physics at \\nCambridge. I think physics is an amazing class to give you transferable skills that are really \\nuseful in other areas, but that’s not why you’re listening to me today; physics isn’t the \\nclass. \\nSo I paid for college doing online marketing, directions marketing. I started with SEO in the \\n1990s. I created a paper airplane site, and had a monopoly in the small niche market of \\npaper airplanes. When you want to start a startup also see how big the market could be. (In \\nthe long term, it wasn’t great.) But what that taught me was how to do SEO. And back in \\nthose days it was Alta Vista, and the way to do SEO was to have white text, on a white \\nbackground, five pages below the fold, and you would rank top of Alta Vista if you just said \\nplanes 20 or 30 times in that text. And that was how you won SEO in the 1990s. It was a \\nreally, really easy skill to learn. \\nWhen I went to college, being a physicist, I thought paper airplanes would make me cool. I \\nwas actually the nerdiest person in the physics class, so I created a cocktail site, which \\nwas how I learned to program and that grew to be the largest cocktail site in the UK. That \\nreally got me into SEO properly when Google launched. So with Google you had to worry \\nabout page rank and getting links back to your site, which basically at that stage meant one \\nlink from the Yahoo directory, got you to the top listing in Google if you had white text and a \\nwhite background below the fold as well. \\nWhen Google launched AdWords, that’s really when I started to do all my marketing. That \\nmeant buying paid clicks from Google and reselling them to eBay for a small margin of like \\n20% using their affiliate program. That was what really kicked me into overdrive, into doing \\nwhat everyone nowadays talks about as growth, growth hacking or growth marketing. In my \\nmind it’s just internet marketing using whatever channel you can to get whatever output \\nyou want, and that’s how I paid for college and that’s how I went from being a physicist to a \\nMarketer - transitioning to the darkside of the force.')], 'answer': \"Based on the provided content from the 'How to Start a Startup' course, here are some actionable insights related to sales and marketing for your startup:\\n\\n1. **Sales is Founder's Responsibility**: As a founder, it's crucial to understand that sales are not just about hiring a sales team once the product is ready. Sales should start from day one, and as a founder, you are the best person to kickstart this process. Your passion for the product and industry knowledge can be more valuable than traditional sales experience. (Lecture 1)\\n\\n2. **Dedicate Time to Sales**: In the early stages of your startup, dedicate specific time and effort to sales. This could involve one of the founders focusing solely on sales activities to move the business forward. Committing yourself to sales, even if it's unfamiliar territory, is essential for growth. (Lecture 1)\\n\\n3. **Understand the Sales Funnel**: Recognize that sales follow a funnel approach, starting from prospecting to closing deals. By understanding the different stages of the sales funnel, you can better track and manage your sales process. This knowledge helps in identifying areas for improvement and optimizing your sales strategy. (Lecture 1)\\n\\n4. **Leverage Growth Marketing**: Growth marketing, also known as growth hacking, involves using various channels to achieve desired outcomes. It's about being creative and resourceful in your marketing efforts to drive growth. Whether it's SEO, paid advertising, or affiliate programs, explore different avenues to reach your target audience and scale your business. (Lecture 6)\\n\\n5. **Experiment and Iterate**: Sales and marketing are not one-size-fits-all. It's essential to experiment with different strategies, measure their effectiveness, and iterate based on the results. Stay agile and be willing to pivot your approach to find what works best for your startup. Continuous learning and adaptation are key to success in sales and marketing.\\n\\n6. **Focus on Hyper Growth**: The course emphasizes that the advice given is geared towards startups aiming for hyper growth and building large companies. Keep this in mind when developing your sales and marketing strategies. Prioritize scalability and long-term growth potential in your approach.\\n\\nBy incorporating these insights into your startup's sales and marketing efforts, you can lay a strong foundation for acquiring customers, driving revenue, and ultimately scaling your business.\"}\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now know the advice the startup course gives about sales and marketing for new companies.\n",

So, if you have a question about \\nwhat we covered last time, I am welcome to answer it now, starting with you. \\n  \\nQ: How do I identify if a market has a fast growth rate now and also for the next ten years? \\n  \\nA: The good news about this is this is one of the big advantages students have. You should \\njust trust your instincts on this. Older people have to basically guess about the \\ntechnologies young people are using. But you can just watch what you're doing and what \\nyour friends are doing and you will almost certainly have better instincts than anybody \\nolder than you. And so the answer to this is just trust your instincts, think about what you're \\ndoing more, think about what you're using, what you're seeing people your age using, that \\nwill almost certainly be the future. \\n  \\nOkay, one more question on the last lecture before we start. \\n  \\nQ: How do you deal with burnout while still being productive and remaining productive. \\n  \\nA: The answer to this is just that it sucks and you keep going. Unlike a student where you \\ncan throw up your hands and say you know I'm really burnt out and I'm just going to get bad \\ngrades this quarter, one of the hard parts about running a startup is that it's real life and \\nyou just have to get through it. The canonical advice is to go on a vacation and that never \\nworks for founders. It's sort of all consuming in this way that is very difficult to understand. \\n  \\nSo what you do is you just keep going. You rely on people, it's really important, founder \\ndepression is a serious thing and you need to have a support network. But the way through \\nburn out is just to address the challenges, to address the things that are going wrong and \\nyou'll eventually feel better.\"), Document(metadata={'page': 59, 'source': 'D:/Data/Circle/BOT/Data/Startup Course Text Data.pdf'}, page_content='problem that we had and it wasn\\'t something that we were super passionate about \\nbuilding out, yet we spent almost a year trying to do this. And so if you just start from T=0 \\nand think about this before you build any product I think you can save yourself a lot of \\nheadache down the road from doing something you don\\'t want to do. \\n  \\nSo say you have a problem and you are able to state it, where do you start and how do you \\nthink of solutions? The first thing you should do is think about the industry that you are \\ngetting yourself into. Whether it is big or whether it is huge, you should really immerse \\nyourself in that industry. And there are a number of ways to do this. \\n  \\nOne is to really become a cog in that industry for a little bit. And so it might seem a little \\ncounterintuitive to do this because most people say that if you really want to disrupt an \\nindustry you should really not be a player in it. Someone who spent 20 or 30 years in an \\nindustry is probably set in their ways and is just used to the way things work and really can\\'t \\nthink about what the inefficiencies are or the things that you can \"disrupt\". However, as a \\nnewbie coming into the industry you really should take one or two months to just really \\nunderstand what all of the little bits and pieces of the industry are and how it works. \\nBecause it\\'s when you get into the details, that\\'s when you start seeing things that you can \\nbe exploiting and things that are really inefficient and may provide a huge overhead cost \\nthat you may be able to cut down. \\n  \\nSo an example of this is that when we started Homejoy, we started with the cleaning \\nindustry, and when we started we were the cleaners ourselves. We started to clean houses \\nand we found out really quickly that we were very bad cleaners. As a result, we said okay, \\nwe have to learn more about this and we went to buy books. We bought books about how \\nto clean, which helped maybe a little bit. We learned a little more about cleaning supplies \\nbut it is sort of like basketball, you can read and learn about basketball but you\\'re not going \\nto get better at it if you don\\'t actually train and throw a basketball into the net. \\n  \\nAnd so we decided that one of us was going to have to learn how to clean. Or at least get \\ntrained by a professional. We actually went to get a job at a cleaning company itself. The \\ncool thing was I learned how to clean from training the few weeks that I was there at the \\ncleaning company, but the even better thing was that I learned a lot about how a local \\ncleaning company works.

Spend time understanding the nuances, inefficiencies, and pain points within the industry. This deep dive can help you identify opportunities for disruption and innovation. As mentioned in the lecture, becoming a part of the industry for a short period can provide valuable insights that may not be apparent from an outsider's perspective.\\n\\n2. **Learn by Doing**: While theoretical knowledge is essential, practical experience is invaluable. In the case of Homejoy, the founders started by cleaning houses themselves to understand the challenges firsthand. This hands-on approach allowed them to identify areas for improvement and innovation within the cleaning industry. Similarly, for product development, actively engaging in the process and gaining real-world experience can lead to better insights and solutions.\\n\\n3. **Iterate and Pivot**: The lecture also highlighted the importance of recognizing when a product or idea is not working and being willing to pivot. Spending time on a project that you are not passionate about or that does not align with market needs can be counterproductive. It's essential to continuously evaluate your product, gather feedback, and be open to making changes or pivoting if necessary to stay aligned with market demands.\\n\\n4. **Address Challenges**: Burnout is a common challenge faced by startup founders. While taking a vacation may not always be a feasible solution, it's crucial to address the root causes of burnout. Building a support network, addressing issues within the startup, and seeking help when needed can help founders navigate through challenging times and prevent burnout from affecting productivity and well-being.\\n\\n5. **Trust Your Instincts**: When evaluating market opportunities for growth, especially in fast-evolving industries, trust your instincts as a young entrepreneur. Being in tune with current trends, technologies, and consumer behaviors can give you a unique perspective on future growth areas. As mentioned in the lecture, observing your own habits and those of your peers can provide valuable insights into emerging market trends.\\n\\nWhile the course content provided insights into various aspects of starting a startup, including ideas, products, teams, and execution, these principles can be applied to product development specifically. By immersing yourself in the industry, learning through practical experience, being open to iteration, addressing challenges effectively, and trusting your instincts, you can enhance your product development process and increase the chances of startup success.\"}\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now have actionable insights related to product development for startups.\n",

If you can just do this \\none thing, if you can just learn to think about the market first, you'll have a big leg up on \\nmost people starting startups. And this is probably the thing we see wrong with Y \\nCombinator apps most frequently, is that people have not thought about the market first, \\nand what people want first. \\n  \\nSo for the next section, I'm going to talk about building a great product. And here, again, I'm \\ngoing to use a very broad definition of product. It includes customer support, the copy you \\nwrite explaining the product, anything involved in your customer's interaction in what you \\nbuilt for them. \\n  \\nTo build a really great company, you first have to turn a great idea into a great product. This \\nis really hard, but its crucially important, and fortunately its pretty fun. Although great \\nproducts are always new to the world, and its hard to give you advice about what to build, \\nthere are enough commonalities that we can give you a lot of advice about how to build it. \\n  \\nOne of the most important tasks for a founder is to make sure that the company builds a \\ngreat product. Until you build a great product, nothing else matters. When really \\nsuccessful startup founders tell the story of their early days its almost always sitting in \\nfront of the computer working on their product, or talking to their customers. That's pretty \\nmuch all the time. They do very little else, and you should be very skeptical if your time \\nallocation is much different. Most other problems that founders are trying to solve, raising \\nmoney, getting more press, hiring, business development, et cetera, these are significantly \\neasier when you have a great product. Its really important to take care of that first. Step \\none is to build something that users love. At YC, we tell founders to work on their product, \\ntalk to users, exercise, eat and sleep, and very little else.
