Your startup is going to be a \\nseparate legal entity. You probably already know this but the primary purpose for forming a \\nseparate legal entity is to protect yourselves from personal liability. If your company ever \\ngets sued, it\\'s not your money in your bank account that the person can take. It\\'s the \\ncorporation\\'s. \\n  \\nThen the question is: where do you form one? Theoretically you have fifty choices, but the \\neasiest place is Delaware. I\\'m sure you\\'re all familiar with that as well. Delaware is in the \\nbusiness of forming corporations. The law there is very clear and very settled. It\\'s the \\nstandard. The other thing is that investors are very comfortable with Delaware. They \\nalready invest in companies that are Delaware corporations. Most of their investments are \\nprobably Delaware corporations. So if you are also a Delaware corporation then everything \\nbecomes much simpler. There\\'s less diligence for the investor to do. You don\\'t have to \\nhave a conversation about whether or not to reincorporate your Washington into Delaware. \\n  \\nWe had a company at YC about two years ago that was originally formed as an LLC in, I\\'ll \\nsay Connecticut.

This is significantly cheaper than hiring a lawyer for this specific task (\"Lecture 18: Mechanics--Legal, Finance, HR, etc.\"). The cost is mentioned as being in the hundreds of dollars, not thousands.\\n\\n3. **Minimal Initial Legal Costs:**  The lecture emphasizes that you can avoid substantial legal fees at the beginning.  You only need a lawyer if your business is complex (involving aspects like HIPAA or extensive privacy policies) or if your fundraising involves intricate term sheets requiring legal review (\"Lecture 18: Mechanics--Legal, Finance, HR, etc.\").\\n\\n\\n**Important Note:** While the lecture advocates for a cost-effective approach to initial incorporation, it doesn\\'t detail the *entire* process involved in registering a business in Delaware or other states.

      "Generated Answer: To register a new startup in the United States, the most efficient approach is to incorporate online in Delaware using a service like Clerky. Delaware is recommended due to its clear and established corporate laws, and investor familiarity.  This method keeps initial legal costs low, in the hundreds rather than thousands of dollars.  A lawyer is only needed for more complex situations involving HIPAA, extensive privacy policies, or intricate fundraising terms.  This information is based on advice from a startup course, and for a complete and legally accurate guide, consulting legal professionals or official state resources is recommended.\n",

Of course, there\\'s a million ways to do this, so you\\'ll find what works for \\nyou. \\n  \\nFirst I want to start about how I used to perceive sales. A lot of people see sales as having \\nmystique around it. It\\'s people who are articulate and impossibly charming. They have \\nthese killer closing lines that they use. This is how I saw sales. I think this is how a lot of \\nfounders I talk to see sales because they say things to me like, \"You know, we\\'re just going \\nto work on the product and build a great product and then when it\\'s finally finished, we\\'re \\ngoing hire the sales people.\" What I\\'ve learned is that when it comes to \"hiring the sales \\npeople,\" as a founder, the reality is that it\\'s you. Paul Graham likes to talk about how \\nthere\\'s two things you should be doing at any point in time when you\\'re starting your \\ncompany. You should be either talking to your users or building your product. The talking to \\nyour users part, that\\'s selling. This is intimidating to some people because they\\'re like, \"I\\'ve \\nnever done sales, and I wouldn\\'t even know where to begin.\" It turns out that as a founder \\nyou have some unique advantages that make it possible for you to be really, really good at \\nsales. One of those is your passion for the product and what you\\'re building. The second is \\nyour knowledge of the industry and the problem that you\\'re solving. Those two things \\nactually totally trump sales experience from what I\\'ve seen. \\n  \\nThis is actually my co-founder doing sales. This is what sales looks like in the very early \\nstage of a startup. It\\'s not Don Drapers. It\\'s a lot of calls like these. This is something that \\neven as a founder who has never done it before, is very easy to do but you have to commit \\nyourself. What we did at Clever is we dedicated one founder, which was me, to peel off and \\nsay, \"Ok, Tyler you gotta go figure this out and work on this full time because it\\'s so \\nimportant to our business.\" \\n  \\nThe first thing that everybody knows about sales is it\\'s a funnel. You have these different \\nstages of the funnel and you move your customers through it. A pretty common category is \\nthe prospecting category. We were trying to figure out who\\'s even interested. Then you\\'re'), Document(metadata={'page': 312, 'source': 'D:/Data/Circle/BOT/Data/Startup Course Text Data.pdf'}, page_content='The second thing I mentioned is cold email. A lot of people don\\'t know how to write cold \\nemails. It\\'s actually easy and the key is not to write a lot. Your email should be concise. \\nThis is an email template that I used early on. You\\'re welcome to copy it but it\\'s really short. \\nHere\\'s who I am. Here\\'s what I\\'m building. I\\'d love to talk to you about this. Could we find \\ntime tomorrow? It\\'s really easy and you can customize this for every business you want to \\nsell to. Find out who the right person is to send it to and you can send out quite a few of \\nthese. \\n  \\nThat\\'s prospecting. The reason this so important is because you have to build that first \\nlayer of the funnel. \\n  \\nThen you have to get them to take your call. This is another place where a lot of founders \\nhave questions about what to actually do. The biggest thing to take away, in fact if you \\nONLY take away one thing from this presentation today this should be it, is when you get \\nthem on the phone, remember to shut up. That\\'s really surprising to people. So many \\nfounders, when I help them with their first sales pitch, would finally get somebody on the \\nphone who wanted to talk to them about their product and they\\'d be so proud of this thing \\nthat they\\'d been building for the last three months that all they wanted to do was get on the \\nphone and talk about every feature and talk about why it\\'s the greatest thing in the world. I \\nhave that temptation too. It\\'s just part of being really proud of something. \\n  \\n  \\nIt turns out that if you watch the best sales people, the top one percent, or you have a \\nchance to listen in on a call with some of those people, the most surprising thing is how \\nlittle talking they do. In fact I\\'ve seen calls where the sales person told me their goal was to \\nonly spend 30 percent of the call talking and have 70 percent of the call be the other \\nperson. They would ask a lot of questions. They\\'d say things like, \"Why did you even agree \\nto take my call today?\" \"This problem that we\\'re talking about solving for you, how do you \\nsolve it today?\" \"What would your ideal solution look like?\" They\\'re not doing the talking. \\nThey\\'re doing everything they can to find out what this person needs and hopefully \\nunderstand their problem even better than they do. That\\'s what really great sales is. This is \\nsomething I drill into everybody at Clever. It\\'s a really important part of sales. If any of you \\nuse UberConference, they have this amazing feature where when you hang up a call it'), Document(metadata={'page': 311, 'source': 'D:/Data/Circle/BOT/Data/Startup Course Text Data.pdf'}, page_content=\"having a lot of conversations, which is the second level of the funnel. Then you're finding \\nout who's really serious and you want to close them and sign the deal. Then you're in the \\npromised land of revenue. I thought it would be interesting to talk about each stage and a \\ncouple of strategies that we've used at Clever that have worked well, so that these aren't \\nabstract but hopefully lessons you can use at your start up. \\n  \\nProspecting is the process of figuring out who will even take your call. There's this guy at \\nEverett Rogers who has created a technology life cycle adoption curve. He describes it as a \\nbell curve where you have innovators who will try new things, early adopters, mid-stage \\nadopters, late adopters, and laggers. One of the things that was really helpful for me in \\nunderstanding sales at an early start up is he's quantified the tail of this bell curve. This \\npart over here are innovators, those are your potential customers. It might seem \\ndiscouraging that only 2.5 percent of companies are your potential customers or would \\neven consider buying from a startup that has no users and no revenue, but I found the \\nopposite. I found it extremely helpful to have this frame of mind because when only 2.5 \\npercent of companies will even take your call or consider using your product, you realize \\nwhat a numbers game this becomes. If you want to reach that 2.5 percent and you want to \\nget some early sales, you're hopefully starting to realize you have to do a lot of calling. You \\nhave to talk to a lot of people. \\n  \\nIn the early days Clever, this was my job. In the first two months of YC I reached out to over \\n400 companies trying to to get them to take a call and talk to us about what we were \\nbuilding. \\n  \\nThere are three methods that I have found to be most successful in prospecting and getting \\nthese people. One is your personal network. That's obvious. I'm not going to spend any \\ntime there. Another one is conferences, which is surprising to a lot of people. The one that \\npeople are most familiar with is cold email. When I say conferences, people think I am \\ntalking about CES or E3. The kind of conferences where sales happen look more like this. In \\nthe early days we would go to a lot of these because you've got to go to where your users \\nare. If you're selling to CIO's and there happens to be a gathering of them at a hotel in \\nMilwaukee, guess what? That's where you should be. So we went to conferences like \\nthese. We got the attendee list in advance. We'd email every single person in advance and \\ntry set up meetings so when we got there every single minute of that trip was was well \\nspent. It was huge in Clever's early days. This is where met all of our earliest customers.\")], 'answer': 'Based on the provided \"How to Start a Startup\" course content, here\\'s actionable advice for sales and marketing in a new company, specifically tailored to early-stage startups like Clever:\\n\\n**I. Reframing Sales:**\\n\\n* **Forget the mystique:**  Don\\'t wait for a \"finished\" product to hire salespeople.  As the founder, *you* are the initial sales team (Lecture on Founder\\'s Role in Sales). This leverages your unique advantages: passion for the product and deep industry knowledge, which outweigh formal sales experience.\\n\\n* **Prioritize user interaction:** Paul Graham\\'s advice to focus on either talking to users or building the product highlights the crucial role of sales in early-stage growth.  \"Talking to users\" *is* selling (Lecture on Founder\\'s Role in Sales).\\n\\n* **Dedicated Sales Focus:** Designate a founder (or team member) to focus on sales full-time. This demonstrates commitment and allows for focused effort in building the sales funnel (Clever\\'s Early Sales Strategy).\\n\\n\\n**II. Building the Sales Funnel:**\\n\\nThe course emphasizes a phased approach: Prospecting → Calls → Closing.\\n\\n**A. Prospecting:**\\n\\n* **Identify your ideal customer:** Leverage Everett Rogers\\' Technology Adoption Curve. Focus on the innovators (2.5% of the market) as your initial target. While seemingly small, this focused approach is more efficient than a broad, less effective strategy (Lecture on Prospecting).\\n\\n* **Multiple Prospecting Methods:**\\n    * **Personal Network:**  Tap into your existing contacts.\\n    * **Conferences:** Attend industry-specific conferences, not large-scale events.  Get the attendee list beforehand and schedule meetings (Lecture on Prospecting).  This allows for highly efficient use of time.\\n    * **Cold Email:** Use a concise, direct template.  Focus on brevity and a clear call to action (Example Cold Email Template Provided).\\n\\n**B. Calls:**\\n\\n* **The Power of Listening:** This is the *most* crucial takeaway from the course.  When on a sales call, *listen more than you talk*.  Your goal is to understand the customer\\'s needs and problems better than they do (Lecture on Sales Calls). Aim for a 70/30 ratio (customer talk/your talk).\\n\\n* **Ask insightful questions:** Instead of pitching features, ask questions like:\\n    * \"Why did you agree to this call?\"\\n    * \"How do you currently solve this problem?\"\\n    * \"What would your ideal solution look like?\"\\n\\n**C. Closing:**\\n\\nThe course doesn\\'t detail specific closing techniques, but the emphasis on understanding customer needs implies a consultative sales approach. Closing should naturally follow from building rapport and demonstrating a clear understanding of their challenges.\\n\\n\\n**III.  Marketing Considerations (Implicit in the Course):**\\n\\nWhile the course focuses heavily on sales, effective marketing is implied through the emphasis on understanding and reaching target customers.  Clever\\'s success with conferences suggests a strong component of targeted marketing.  Consider these aspects:\\n\\n* **Content Marketing:**  Create blog posts, case studies, or webinars demonstrating your expertise and addressing the pain points of your target audience.\\n* **Social Media:**  Use platforms relevant to your target audience (e.g., LinkedIn for schools and educators).\\n* **Public Relations:**  Seek out opportunities to get mentioned in relevant publications or industry blogs.\\n\\n\\n**IV.  Applying this to Clever:**\\n\\nGiven Clever\\'s existing market penetration (one in five schools), the focus should shift from acquiring *any* customer to acquiring *high-value* customers.  This may involve targeting larger school districts or those with specific needs that Clever can uniquely address.  The sales strategies above remain relevant, but the prospecting and targeting should become more refined.\\n\\n\\n**Limitations:**\\n\\nThe provided text focuses heavily on sales and doesn\\'t offer detailed marketing strategies beyond the implied aspects.  More specific advice on marketing channels, content creation, and branding would require additional information.\\n'}\u001B[0m\u001B[32;1m\u001B[1;3mThought:I now know the final answer.

Not, \"Do you want a \\ndigital portable music player?\" \\n  \\nAgain it\\'s at a price that was more than your phone. So you have to separate what are \\nquestions that you can ask that are going to help make you smarter about your thesis \\nversus trying to get somebody to validate it for you. That\\'s the real separation. No one\\'s \\ngoing to tell you what to build, if they do then they should do it and not you.

Of course, it would be best to build \\nsomething that a small number of users love, but opportunities to do that for v1 are rare, \\nand they're usually not available to startups. So in practice you end up choosing the gray or \\nthe orange. You make something that a lot of users like a little bit, or something that a \\nsmall number of users love a lot. This is a very important piece of advice. Build something \\nthat a small number of users love. It is much easier to expand from something that small \\nnumber of people love, to something that a lot of people love, then from something that a \\nlot of people like to a lot of people love. If you get right, you can get a lot of other things \\nwrong. If you don't get this right, you can get everything else right, and you'll probably still \\nfail. So when you start on the startup, this is the only thing you need to care about until its \\nworking. \\n  \\n[Audience member]: Can you go over that slide again? \\n  \\nSo you have a choice in a startup. The best thing of all worlds is to build a product that a lot \\nof people really love. In practice, you can't usually do that, because if there's an \\nopportunity like that, Google or Facebook will do it. So there's like a limit to the area under \\nthe curve, of what you can build. So you can build something that a large number of users \\nlike a little bit, or a small number of users love a lot. So like the total amount of love is the \\nsame, its just a question of how its distributed. [audience laughter] And there's like this law \\nof conservation of how much happiness you can put in the world, with the first product of a \\nstartup. \\n  \\nAnd so startups always struggle, with which of those two they should go. And they seem \\nequal, right? Because the area under the curve is the same. But we've seen this time and \\nagain, that they're not. And that it's so much easier to expand, once you've got something \\nthat some people love, you can expand that into something that a lot of other people love. \\nBut if you start with ambivalence, or weak enthusiasm, and try to expand that, you'll never \\nget up to a lot of people loving it. So the advice is: find a small group of users, and make \\nthem love what you're doing\"), Document(metadata={'page': 108, 'source': 'D:/Data/Circle/BOT/Data/Startup Course Text Data.pdf'}, page_content='login, the links, the advertisements, the very first time you interacted with customer \\nsupport. All of those are opportunities to seduce. \\n  \\nSo how do we think about making first moments? We actually took this concept from the \\nJapanese. They actually have two words for how to describe things when you\\'re finished \\nwith them, in terms of saying, \"is this a quality item?\" The two words for quality are \\natarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu. The first one means taken for granted \\nquality, which basically means functionality. The last one means enchanting quality. Take \\nfor example a pen. Something has miryokuteki if the weight of the pen, the way the ink \\nflows out of it, the way it\\'s viewed by the people reading the hand writing from the pen, is \\npleasurable both to the user of the pen and the people who experience the byproducts, \\ntaking it to the next level. Let\\'s start with some examples. \\n  \\nThis is Wufoo\\'s login link, and it has a dinosaur on it, which I think is awesome! But if you \\nhover it, the spec has the added benefit of having a tool tip that doesn\\'t tell you how to log \\nin or what it does, but basically \"RARRR!\" What we noticed about this in early usability \\nstages, is that this put a smile on people’s faces, like hands down, universally. I think a lot \\nof times when we are assessing products we never think about, \"Hey, what is the emotion \\non the person\\'s face when they interact with this?\" \\n  \\nThis is Vimeo\\'s launching page; this is actually a couple iterations ago, it\\'s the one that I \\nfind to be the most beautiful. It lets you know that when you\\'re starting out on this journey \\nwith them, it is going to be something different - they do this all over. If you search for the \\nword \"fart,\" as you scroll up and down, it makes fart noises. There\\'s something different, \\nlike this site interacts with you, it\\'s a little bit magical, and it’s a little bit different. It\\'s \\nsomething that you want to talk about. \\nYou don\\'t always have to do it with design. This is a sign-up form for Cork\\'d, which used to \\nbe a social network for people that love to drink wine. On it, it says, \"Email address- it\\'s \\nalso your sign in name, and has to be legit. First name – what mom calls you. Last name - \\nwhat your army buddies call you. Password – something you\\'ll remember but hard to \\nguess. Password confirmation – type it again, think of it as a test.\" It\\'s literally a poem as \\nyou fill it out the form. And this is the kind of thing when you\\'re like, \"Oh, I like the people \\nbehind this, I’m going to enjoy this experience.\" Now what does it say, when you fill out a \\nform like this, about what their personality looks like it\\'s going to be? And what\\'s')], 'answer': 'Based on the provided course content,  creating a product users love hinges on several key factors, primarily focusing on exceeding expectations and building a strong emotional connection:\\n\\n**1. Focusing on User Needs, Not Just Wants:** The course emphasizes understanding user *behavior* and *lifestyle* rather than directly asking them what they want (as in traditional focus groups).  This is crucial because users often can\\'t articulate their unmet needs, or may not be aware of the potential of innovative solutions.  Instead of asking \"Do you want a digital music player?\",  ask questions like \"How much music do you listen to when you\\'re with other people? How do you play that music?\". This approach allows you to identify underlying needs and build a product that solves problems users didn\\'t even know they had (as with the iPod example). This aligns with the core concept of \"problem/solution fit\" frequently discussed in startup courses.\\n\\n**2. Prioritizing \"Love\" over \"Like\":**  The course strongly advocates for building a product that a *small number of users love* intensely, rather than a large number who merely *like* it.  This is because a passionately engaged user base is much easier to expand from.  A small group of fervent users becomes your early adopters, providing valuable feedback and acting as organic marketers.  This concept directly addresses the \"minimum viable product\" (MVP) and early-stage growth strategies.  The course suggests that even if you get many other aspects wrong, achieving this \"love\" is the most crucial factor for early success.\\n\\n**3.  Creating \"Enchanting Quality\" Beyond Functionality (\"miryokuteki hinshitsu\"):** The lecture introduces the Japanese concepts of *atarimae hinshitsu* (taken-for-granted quality, or functionality) and *miryokuteki hinshitsu* (enchanting quality).  The course stresses that the best products go beyond mere functionality.  They incorporate delightful surprises, unexpected interactions, and emotional connections. Examples included a dinosaur login button with a \"RAWR!\" tooltip, a website that makes fart noises when searching \"fart,\" and a witty signup form. This highlights the importance of user experience (UX) design that goes beyond usability and into the realm of emotional engagement.  This resonates with the concept of \"delightful surprises\" often discussed in design thinking methodologies.\\n\\n**4.  Mastering \"First Moments\":** The course emphasizes the importance of making a strong first impression.  Every interaction, from login to customer support, is an opportunity to \"seduce\" the user and create a positive emotional connection. This underscores the importance of meticulously designing the user journey, ensuring that every touchpoint reinforces the brand\\'s personality and values.  This is directly relevant to the principles of \"user onboarding\" often taught in startup courses.\\n\\n\\nIn short, building a product users love requires a deep understanding of their underlying needs, a focus on creating intensely positive experiences, and a willingness to prioritize passionate engagement over broad appeal, especially in the early stages.  The course stresses that this is not about validating a pre-conceived idea with users, but using user feedback to refine and improve a core thesis.\\n'}\u001B[0m\u001B[32;1m\u001B[1;3mThought: I now know the final answer.
